                    He was the chief minister of Gujarat from 2001 to 2014 and is the Member of Parliament for Varanasi.
                     Modi is a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its National Democratic Alliance (NDA). 
                     He is also a member of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu nationalist volunteer organisation. 
                     He is the first prime minister born after India's independence in 1947, the second non-Congress one to win two consecutive terms after Atal Bihari Vajpayee and the first from outside the Congress to win both terms with a majority in the Lok Sabha.

                    Born and raised in Vadnagar, a small town in northeastern Gujarat, Modi completed his secondary education there, and is said to have helped his father sell tea at the local railway station. 
                    He was introduced to the RSS at age eight.Modi left home at age 18 soon after his marriage to Jashodaben Chamanlal, which he publicly acknowledged many decades later. 
                    Modi has asserted that he travelled around India for two years, visiting a number of religious centres.
                    Upon his return to Gujarat in 1971, he became a full-time worker for the RSS. 
                    During the state of emergency imposed across the country in 1975, Modi went into hiding. 
                    The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and he held several positions within the party hierarchy until 2001, rising to the rank of general secretary.

                    Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat in 2001 due to Keshubhai Patel's failing health and poor public image following the earthquake in Bhuj. 
                    Modi was elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration has been considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,or otherwise criticised for its handling of it. 
                    A Supreme Court-appointed Special Investigation Team found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings against Modi personally.
                    His policies as chief minister, credited with encouraging economic growth, have received praise.
                    His administration has been criticised for failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices in the state
